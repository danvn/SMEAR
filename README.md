## Foreward
This project was meant to show each individual players social media engagement in comparison to their replacement player counterparts, however I found that data was scarce because not all of these players have their own accounts on each platform. The SMEAR Rating was transitioned into the TWMPRG metric. A team's Twitter Mentions Per Run per Game.
