# SMEAR
## Working Demo
https://www.dannguyen.me/SMEAR
Currently having trouble loading assets because I'm using a custom domain on GH Pages through Jekyll. 
Still figuring out how to get those in, but the project can run locally on any machine

## Running Locally
1) Clone this repository: ```git clone git@github.com:danvn/SMEAR.git```
2) Move into the project: ```cd SMEAR```
3) Run the local server, this will serve the `index.html` file: ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer```

## Foreword
This project was meant to show each individual players social media engagement in comparison to their replacement player counterparts, however I found that data was scarce because not all of these players have their own accounts on each platform. The SMEAR Rating was transitioned into the TWMPRG metric. A team's Twitter Mentions Per Run per Game.
