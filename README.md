# SMEAR
apparently Instagram's API was suddenly deprecated just [recently](https://later.com/blog/instagram-api/). I'll be using Twitter mentions of teams instead. Also I found so far I have the top 8 players of the rockies and the dodgers followers correlated to their salary. 

I'm switching the twitter api and it will be way better I promsie!
